## Changelog
Unlike Xenos Install Kit I won't update the changelog after every new push.<br/>
Instead you may refer to the commit history for differences.


## Purpose
Daechir dots are my personal dot configuration files to be used with [Xenos Install Kit](https://github.com/daechir/xenos-install-kit).<br />
I am releasing them here solely for version control and backup purposes.<br />
Like all my other works this repo is also liscensed under GNU GPL.<br />
If you decide to use my dot files please leave the author stamp in place (Per GNU GPL) as most of the files here are original works with many hours of research, testing and implementation invested in each.


## Usage
First add your wallpaper.zip to the wallpapers folder.<br/>
Second update the wallfile variable in install_config to match your wallpaper.zip name.<br/>
Third execute the script:<br/><br/>
`bash D.sh`<br/><br/>
Fourth reboot.<br/>
Fifth comment out prepare_config and install_config.<br/>
Sixth uncomment install_extra_config.<br/>
Seventh re-execute the script to apply the proper gsettings.<br/>
Eighth reboot again.
