## Changelog
Unlike Xenos Install Kit I won't update the changelog after every new push.<br/>
Instead you may refer to the commit history for differences.


## Purpose
Daechir dots are my personal dot configuration files to be used with [Xenos Install Kit](https://github.com/daechir/xenos-install-kit).<br />
I am releasing them here solely for version control and backup purposes.<br />
Like all my other works this repo is also liscensed under GNU GPL.<br />
If you decide to use my dot files please just credit me as the original author somewhere as most of the files here are original works with many hours of research, testing and implementation invested in each.


## Usage
First add your wallpaper.zip to the wallpapers folder.<br/>
Second update the variables in install_config to match your wallpaper.zip.<br/>
Lastly just run the script:<br/><br/>
`chmod +x D.sh`<br/>
`./D.sh`
<br/><br/> Or <br/><br/>
`bash D.sh`
<br/><br/> Note: gsettings may have to be reapplied after rebooting in some cases.
